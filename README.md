Welcome!

The content of this repository is available for you so you can reproduce any demo or learn how to present any session of the Learning Path presented at [Migrosoft Ignite](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ignite) and during [Microsoft Ignite The Tour](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/ignite-the-tour/), in your local field office, a community user group, or even as a lunch-and-learn event for your company.

## Do the Demos

If you are here to reproduce a demo in the comfort of your home/office, go in in the section [Sessions](#sessions). In each session you will find deployment instructions, to create the environment you need, and a tutorial to do the demo step by step.

## Presenting the content

We're glad you are here and look forward to your delivery of this amazing content. As an experienced presenter, we know you know HOW to present so this guide will focus on WHAT you need to present. It will provide you a full run-through of the presentation created by the presentation design team.

Along with the video of the presentation, this repository will link to all the assets you need to successfully present including PowerPoint slides and demo instructions & code.

## Sessions

Here all the sessions available in the learning path **Modern Data Warehouse** (aka: **DATA**)

### [**DATA10**: Delivering the Modern Data Warehouse with Azure SQL Data Warehouse, Azure Databricks, Azure Data Factory and PBI](./data10/README.md)

In this experience, see how Azure Data Factory (ADF), Azure Databricks, and Azure SQL Data Warehouse (SQL DW) can be used together to build a modern data warehouse. Start by using Azure Data Factory (ADF) to automate the movement of data in various formats gathered from various sources, including Azure Cosmos DB, into a centralized repository, Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2) in this case. Then, use Azure Databricks to prepare and analyze those data, and finally write the aggregations to Azure SQL Data Warehouse (SQL DW).

### [**DATA20**: Ingesting data with Azure Data Factory](./data20/README.md)

In this experience, walk through creating a pipeline copy activity to copy a file to an Azure blob storage container, so we can prepare the file to be processed later for transformation.
