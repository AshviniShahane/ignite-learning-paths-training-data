        FILE_FORMAT=TextFile
    );
    ```

1. In **SQL Server Management Studio**, highlight the statement and then click on **Execute**.

1. Test that the table is created by running a select statement against it

    ```SQL
    SELECT * FROM dbo.DimDate2External;
    ```

1. In **SQL Server Management Studio**, in the Query window, type in a **CTAS** statement that creates a table named **dbo.Dates** with a **columnstore** index and a **distribution** of **round robin** that loads data from the **dbo.DimDate2External** table.

    ```SQL
    CREATE TABLE dbo.Dates
    WITH
    (   
        CLUSTERED COLUMNSTORE INDEX,
        DISTRIBUTION = ROUND_ROBIN
    )
    AS
    SELECT * FROM [dbo].[DimDate2External];
    ```

1. In **SQL Server Management Studio**, highlight the statement and then click on **Execute**.
 
1. In **SQL Server Management Studio**, in the Query window, type in a query that creates statistics on the **DateKey**, **Quarter** and **Month** column.

    ```SQL
    CREATE STATISTICS [DateKey] on [Dates] ([DateKey]);
    CREATE STATISTICS [Quarter] on [Dates] ([Quarter]);
    CREATE STATISTICS [Month] on [Dates] ([Month]);
    ```

1. Test that the table is created by running a select statement against it

    ```SQL
    SELECT * FROM dbo.Dates;
    ```
